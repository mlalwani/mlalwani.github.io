<h3> <a href="https://github.com/briankhau/mdsim"> Molecular Dynamics Simulator</a> (Collaboration with <a href="https://github.com/briankhau"> Brian Khau</a>): </h3>

Simulator featuring particles interacting in a confined box, modeled using the Lennard-Jones potential. Currently animable in two dimensions. Tunable parameters include: Number of particles, size of the box, and system temperature.

To be added: different potential models, system information dumps to text files, polar molecular properties.
